# Rheumalyze
This project provides a client-based webtool tool that classifies rheumatoid arthritis into four distinct phenotypes based on initial clinical presentation, that were primarily characterized by their unique joint involvement pattern (JIP): feet, oligoarticular, hand, and polyarticular distribution.
